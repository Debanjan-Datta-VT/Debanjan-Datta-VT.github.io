Debanjan Datta graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from Virginia Tech in 2022, advised by Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan, with a focus on Machine Learning and Anomaly Detection.

As an Applied Scientist II at Amazon Web Services, he specializes in developing enterprise-scale AI/ML solutions with a focus on **agentic systems and automated machine learning**. Currently part of AWS's Agentic organization, he focuses on initiatives in data processing agents and LLM-powered systems that democratize machine learning for business users. His research portfolio spans **anomaly detection, time series mining, NLP, and Large Language Models**, with extensive experience in building production-ready systems that handle complex, large-scale data across diverse domains. Recent work includes developing advanced agentic memory systems for long-term temporal knowledge, optimizing Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for enterprise LLM deployment, and creating chat-based ML pipeline automation tools that enable non-technical users to leverage machine learning through intuitive interfaces.

At AWS, he has contributed to key services including **AWS SageMaker Canvas**, **AWS Lookout for Metrics**, and **SageMaker Unified Studio**, designing scalable managed ML solutions across data types. His work emphasizes the intersection of cutting-edge applied research and practical enterprise applications, with a track record of launching products that directly impact customer experience and business outcomes.

His technical expertise includes multiple sub-domains of MAchine Learning & AI, combined with strong software engineering skills that enable him to build robust, customer-facing ML systems at scale.
